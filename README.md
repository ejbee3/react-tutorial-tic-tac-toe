## React Tutorial

In preparation for my new training and job, I decided I'd brush up on my React skills! The official React tutorial is actually really nice. It's pre-hooks, but I still learned some very useful things... [check it out!](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#setup-option-2-local-development-environment "react tutorial")

### Things I learned:

- you can pass functions to children components! I know, it seems obvious, but for some reason this was not apparent to me before.
- immutability is important! In order to implement the time travel feature it was necessary to use slice() and concat() methods to make copies of the move history.
- class components are used for state and function components are used to pass props (obviously this changes a little bit since the useState() hook is a thing now)
